# PySpark Year-Month Partitioning Project

## 1. What Did I Do?

I implemented a solution to partition large datasets by year and month in PySpark. This approach is crucial in data warehousing and big data environments where managing and optimizing query performance on massive datasets is necessary. The project focuses on restructuring the data to improve the efficiency of queries that filter by date, ultimately making data processing more streamlined and scalable.

## 2. How Did I Do It?

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Imported the data files into the PySpark environment.
   - Created a DataFrame and inferred the schema to identify data types, ensuring the data was ready for processing.

2. **Adding Partitioning Columns**:
   - Extracted the year and month from the date column using the `date_format` function.
   - These new columns were then used to partition the data.

3. **Creating Partitioned Tables**:
   - Saved the DataFrame as a partitioned table by year and month using the `partitionBy` clause in PySpark.
   - Verified the directory structure to ensure that the partitioning was correctly applied.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Ensured that the data types of the partitioning columns matched those used in queries to avoid unnecessary type casting during execution.
   - Implemented appropriate filters that matched the partition column data types to further optimize query performance.

## 3. What Was the Impact?

- **Improved Query Performance**:
  - The partitioning by year and month significantly reduced query times when filtering data by date, making data retrieval more efficient.
  
- **Enhanced Data Management**:
  - By structuring the data into year/month partitions, the overall organization of the dataset was improved, making it easier to manage and scale as the data grew.

- **Error Reduction**:
  - Properly converting date formats and ensuring data type consistency minimized the risk of errors during data processing, leading to more reliable and accurate data handling.

- **Scalability**:
  - The implementation provided a scalable solution that can handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for real-time data warehousing and big data projects.
