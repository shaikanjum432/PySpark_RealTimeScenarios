# Dynamic Column Handling in PySpark: Processing Unstructured Data with Variable Column Counts

## 1. What Did I Do?

In this project, I addressed the challenge of processing unstructured data files that contain a dynamic or varying number of columns using PySpark. The data source often generates files without fixed schemas or headers, which posed challenges for standard data processing methods. This project focused on effectively handling such files to ensure data integrity and flexibility.
## 2. How Did I Do It?

- **Initial Attempt: Using `csv` Method**
  - I initially attempted to load the data using PySpark's `csv` method, but this caused issues because PySpark treated the first row as defining the number of columns, leading to problems when subsequent rows had more or fewer columns.

- **Solution: Reading as a Text File**
  - To resolve the issue, I read the file as a text file, treating each row as a single string to prevent data loss.
   
- **Splitting the Data**
  - I used PySpark's `split` function to divide the single string column into an array of values based on a comma delimiter. This array was then used to generate the actual columns.
  
- **Determining the Maximum Number of Columns**
  - I determined the maximum number of columns needed by finding the maximum size of the arrays in each row.

- **Generating Dynamic Columns**
  - I dynamically generated columns based on the maximum column size, ensuring that all possible columns were accounted for in the DataFrame.
   

- **Cleaning Up**
  - After successfully creating the new columns, I dropped the original single-column data to retain only the dynamically generated columns.


## 3. What Was the Impact?

- **Effective Data Processing:** This approach allowed me to effectively manage unstructured data in PySpark, even when dealing with files that had varying numbers of columns.
- **Flexibility:** By dynamically generating columns, I was able to process data with no loss of information, regardless of the column inconsistencies.
- **Improved Data Integrity:** Treating the data as a text file and then splitting it into columns ensured that no data was discarded or misinterpreted, providing a reliable solution for processing complex, unstructured datasets.
